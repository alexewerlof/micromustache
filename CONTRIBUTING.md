# Before making a PR

Always make an issue first before putting the effort into a PR.

The goal of MicroMustache is to be minimalist but if there's something that is terribly missing, we may add it, otherwise, you may fork it and call it something else OR use MustacheJS.

# Tests

We use Jest for tests. If you want to run the tests, install dependencies and run them:

```bash
npm it
```
