# What?

A super simple and stupid JQuery-slide playground to try micromustache.
Not much time has been put into making this a super duper awesome web application with tests and
lots of comments but it does the job and is enough for now.

# How?

To run it locally,
1. Build micromustache `npm run build:ts`
2. Open the HTML file in the browser: `google-chrome playground/index.html`
