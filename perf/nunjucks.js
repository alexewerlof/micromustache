const nunjucks = require('nunjucks')

// Mozilla's Nunjucks: nunjucks does not sandbox execution so it is not safe to run user-defined templates or inject user-defined content into template definitions. On the server, you can expose attack vectors for accessing sensitive data and remote code execution. On the client, you can expose cross-site scripting vulnerabilities even for precompiled templates (which can be mitigated with a strong CSP). See this issue for more information.
