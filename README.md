# micromustache

![Logo](https://raw.github.com/userpixel/micromustache/master/logo.png)

A minimalist, fast and **secure** [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) template engine with some handy additions.

**Think of it as a sweet spot between plain text interpolation and [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js); Certainly not as logic-ful as [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/)! Sometimes a stricter syntax is the right boundary to reduce potential errors and improve performance.**

* üèÉ **2x-3x** faster than MustacheJS
* üîí **Secure**. Works in CSP environments (no usage of `eval()` or `new Function()`). Published only with 2FA. No risk for [regexp DDoS](https://medium.com/@liran.tal/node-js-pitfalls-how-a-regex-can-bring-your-system-down-cbf1dc6c4e02).
* üéà **Lightweight** No dependencies, less than 400 lines of source code, small API surface, easy to pick up
* üêÅ **Smaller memory footprint.** sane caching, no memory leak
* üè≥ **No dependencies**
* ü§ì **Bracket notation** support `a[1]['foo']` accessors (mustache.js syntax of `a.1.foo` is still supported).
* üö© **Meaningful errors** in case of template syntax errors to make it easy to spot and fix. All functions test their input contracts and throw meaningful errors to improve developer experience (DX)
* ‚ö° **TypeScript** types included and updated with every version of the library
* üêá Works in node (CommonJS) and Browser (using CommonJS build tools like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/))
* üõ† Well tested (full test coverage over 120+ tests)
* üìñ Full JSDoc documentation
* [CLI](./bin/README.md) for quickly doing interpolations without having to write a program

## Tradeoffs

Micromustache achieves its faster speed and smaller size by dropping the following features from [MustacheJS](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js):

* Array iterations: `{{# ...}}` (you can still pass the result in a variable)
* Partials: `{{> ...}}`
* Inverted selection: `{{^ ...}}`
* Comments: `{{! ...}}`
* HTML sanitization: `{{{ propertyName }}}`

If variable interpolation is all you need, *micromustache* is a [drop-in replacement](src/mustachejs.spec.js) for MustacheJS.

# Getting started

Install:

```bash
$ npm i micromustache
```

Use:

```javascript
const { render } = require('micromustache')
console.log(render('Hello {{name}}!', { name: 'world' }))
// Hello world!
```

So what's the point? Why not just use EcmaScript [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)?

Template literals work great when the template and the variables are in the same scope. For example, suppose you have a function like this:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hi ${name}!`
}
```

After your function became successful and you get rich, you may decide to dominate the world and expand to new markets which speak other languages. You need to internationalize it. Adding one more language is easy:

```javascript
function greet(name, lang) {
  return lang === 'sv' ? `Hej ${name}!` : `Hi ${name}!`
}
```

But how about a bunch of them?

```javascript
function greet(name, lang) {
  switch (lang) {
    case 'sv': return `Hej ${name}!`
    case 'es': return `Hola ${name}!`
    default:
    case 'en': return `Hi ${name}!`
  }
}
```

You get the picture, that doesn't scale well! The main problem is that the content (the text) is coupled to the function (the variable interpolation). Template engines help you to move the content out of the function and let something else deal with that concern.

```javascript
const { render } = require('micromustache')
// A very simplified i18n database
const db = {
  en: {
    greeting: 'Hi {{name}}!',
    // ...
  },
  sv: {
    greeting: 'Hej {{name}}!',
    // ...
  },
  // ...
}

function greet(name, lang) {
  return render(db[lang].greeting, { name } )
}
```

Just like template literals, you can of course reference deep nested objects:

```javascript
const { render } = require('micromustache')
const scope = {
  fruits: [{
    name: 'Apple', color: 'red',
    name: 'Banana', color: 'yellow',
  }]
}
console.log(render('I like {{fruits[1].color}}!', scope))
// I like Bababa!
```

*It worth to note that Mustache and Handlebars don't support `fruits[1].color` syntax and rather expect you to write it as `fruits.1.color`.*

The real power of micromustache comes from letting you resolve a variable name to something you choose. To pass a resolver function, you can use `renderFn()` instead of `render()`:

```javascript
const { renderFn } = require('micromustache')
const up = str => str.toUpperCase()

console.log(renderFn('My name is {{Alex}}!', up))
// My name is ALEX!
```

If you want to lookup a key in an object, there's a `get()` function as well:

```javascript
const { renderFn, get } = require('micromustache')

function star(str, scope) {
  // str is 'password'
  // scope is { password: 'abc' }
  const value = get(scope, str) // value is 'abc'
  return '*'.repeat(value.length)
}

console.log(renderFn('My password is {{password}}!', star, { password: 'abc' }))
// My password is ***!
```


You can even resolve asynchronously using the `renderFnAsync()`. For example the following code uses [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) to get a task title from the [jsonplaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

```javascript
const { renderFnAsync } = require('micromustache')
const fetch = require('node-fetch')

async function taskTitleFromUrl(url) {
  const response = await fetch(url)
  const obj = await response.json()
  return obj.title
}

console.log(await renderFnAsync('Got {{https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1}}!', fetch))
// Got delectus aut autem
```

If you find yourself working on a particular template too often, you can compile it once and cache the result so the future renders will be much faster. The compiler returns an object with `render()`, `renderFn()` and `renderFnAsync()` methods with the difference that their first parameter is not the template string:

```javascript
const { compile } = require('micromustache')
const compiled = compile('Hello {{name}}! I am {{age}} years old!')
console.log(compiled.render({ name: 'world', age: 42 }))
// Hello world! I'm 42
// The methods are bound so you can use the destructed version for brevity
const { render } = compile
console.log(render({ name: 'world', age: 42 }))
// Hello world! I'm 42
```

*If `compiled` is garbage collected, the cache is freed (unlike some other template engines that dearly keep hold of the compiled result in their cache which leads to memory leaks and out of memory errors over longer usage).*

Using the options you can do all sorts of fancy stuff. For example, here is an imitation of the C# string interpolation syntax:

```javascript
const { render } = require('micromustache')
const $ = scope => strings => render(strings[0], scope, { tags: ['{', '}'] })

const name = 'Michael'
console.log($({ name })`Hello {name}!`)
// Hello Michael!
```

# FAQ

**Q. How do I do loops?**

Unlike MustacheJS or Handlebars, micromustache does not have a custom syntax for loops. Instead it encourages you to use JavaScript for that (pretty much how JSX avoids custom template syntax and encourages using `.map()`).

For example if you have an array of objects:

```javascript
const { render } = require('micromustache')

const people = [
  { name: 'Alex', age: 37 },
  { name: 'Oskar', age: 35 },
  { name: 'Anna', age: 43 }
]

console.log(render(`There are ${people.length} people:\n${peopleBrief}`, {
  people,
  peopleBrief: people.map(p => render(`${name}, ${age} years old`, p)).join('\n')
}))
```

**Q. How do you threat resolver functions?**

The `renderFn()` and `renderFnAsync()` get a function as their second parameter and run them for every variable name in the template. The function gets the variable name and the scope as arguments and is supposed to return the resolved value ready to be injected into the template string. If your function throws, `renderFn()/renderFnAsync()` throw as well.

**Q. Do you support multiple scopes and lookup fall back mechanisms?**

This can easily be done using JavaScript object-spread operator as seen in one of the [examples](./examples).

# Differences with Mustache

Mustache allows variables with empty names. All of these are valid in Mustache:

* `{{}}`
* `{{ }}`
* `{{   }}`

However Mustache accepts some other invalid parameters.
For example:

```javascript
mustache.render('{{a{{b}}', {
  a: 'foo',
  b: 'bar'
  'a{{b': 'wat?',
}) // gives "wat?"
```

# Known issues

For the sake of speed and smaller code size, some edge cases are not addressed but you should be aware of:

**A varName cannot include the `']'` character**

For example if you have an object like:

```javascript
const a = {
  ']': 'close'
}
```

`a[']']` will not give `'close'` but rather throws a syntax error complaining that you have a mismatching quotation!

**Variable names don't require string delimiters:**

Suppose you have this in Javascript:

```javascript
const a = {
  'foo': 'bar'
}
```

If you want to get the value of the `foo` property, in Javascript you can say `a['foo']`. This works in micromustache too but you can also say `a[foo]` which is not valid Javascript strictly speaking but works without error.

**No support for comments**

Unlike Mustache.js you cannot comment a variable name.
You can of course work around this limitation by using your own resolve function.

**No escape sequence**

The templates cannot currently contain `{{` and there's no way to escape it. One workaround is to literally pass `'{{'` as a value for a variable. Another workaround is to explicitly set the `tags` option to something other than `['{{', '}}']`, for example `['<', '>']`. 

**No nested variables**

Currently there is no way to use a nested variable name:

```javascript
const scope = {
  a: ['Java', 'Python', 'Ruby'],
  b: 'foo'
}

micromustache.render(`My favorite language is not {{a[b]}}`)
// 'foo'
```

Will not give `'Python'` because `a[b]` is treated as `a['b']` or `a.b`. In other words instead of `scope.a[scope.b]` it gives the value of `scope.a.b`.
